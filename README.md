## Background

One of the most common tools environmental labs use to analyse samples is a piece of equipment called a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). This equipment can be divided into two sections; the gas chromatograph (GC) and the mass spectrometer (MS). The GC is used to process the sample and deliver it to the MS. The MS is used to detect and measure environmental contaminants in the samples. This project will be focusing on the MS.

The MS has three main sections that perform different roles. These are the source, the mass filter, and the detector. The source has a pair of filaments, where one acts to emit a beam of electrons and the other acts of an electron trap to receive the electrons. The sample is introduced to the source and the molecules of interest encounter the electron beam. The electron beam removes an electron from the molecule, causing it to become ionised and have a positive charge. The positively charged molecule is then pushed out of the ion source using a positive charged plate called a repeller. The ion is then focused using a series of lenses which are held at different voltages before it is passes into the mass filter.

Different molecules have different masses depending on the number of carbon, hydrogen, and other atoms in its structure. For example, benzene (a common environmental contaminant) has a molecular mass of 78, while toluene (another contaminant) has a molecular mass of 92. The role of the mass filter is to distinguish the mass of the ions by only allowing one mass to reach the detector at a time. This is performed by applying certain voltages to a set of four parallel rods. Depending on the voltages, a certain mass will be able to pass through and reach the detector.

The role of the detector is to measure how many ions of each mass pass through the mass filter. The signal determined by the detector is then used to measure how much of each contaminant is present in the sample.
